# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Curse and Decryptionite (For Learning Purposes Only)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**FOR LEARNING PURPOSES ONLY. THIS CODE IS ONLY TO DISPLAY HOW THIS CERTAIN MALWARE WORKS.**

This repository contains a pair of Python scripts designed to demonstrate basic encryption and decryption using the `cryptography` library. The purpose of these scripts is to illustrate how ransomware-like functionality can be implemented and mitigated in a controlled, educational setting.

üö´ **Do not use this code for malicious purposes. Unauthorized use may violate laws and result in severe penalties.**

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview

- **`curse.py`:** Encrypts files in the directory using a generated key and displays a fictional ransom note.  
- **`decryptionite.py`:** Decrypts the files using the generated key, restoring them to their original state.

---

## ‚ö° How It Works

1. The `curse.py` script searches the current directory for files, excluding itself, the decryption script, and the key file.  
2. It generates a unique encryption key using `Fernet.generate_key()` and saves it to `thekey.key`.  
3. The script then encrypts each file's contents using the key and writes a fictional ransom note, simulating ransomware behavior.  
4. The `decryptionite.py` script reads the key from `thekey.key` and decrypts the files, restoring them to their original state.
